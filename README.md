Telomerase is a modpack for the TFC+ mod, which is obviously the best version of TFC. (thanks Dunk)

This pack was inspired by TNFC which used old TFC. The aim of this pack is to honor the vanilla TFC progression more than TNFC while still providing quest guided progression and a longer end game using tech mods such as Immersive Engineering, Forestry and Big Reactors. There are also decorations added by Bibliocraft and TFC+ Aesthetics and Storage solutions from Better Storage and Storage Drawers. To provide options for automation, we included Piston Everything (Yay pushable tile entities), Pistronics, hopperducts and redstone paste. Et Futurum Requiem, several resource packs and quality of life mods provide a more modern feel to an ancient version of minecraft. The pack is carefully wrapped together using CraftTweaker and our very own compatibility addons.

Whether you are new to TFC or a long time veteran, this modpack is a great way to enjoy TFC+. That said, TFC+ is not a simple mod and will likely require the use of the wiki. 

Please leave a comment, send me a message or ping me on the TFC+ discord if you have any issues, suggestions or contributions.

# Installation
To install Telomerase:
- Install a supported minecraft launcher: MultiMC, Prism, ATLauncher, etc. Note: the CurseForge launcher currently has issues with this pack.
- Find Telomerase within the launcher (It is on both Modrinth and CurseForge) and install the pack.
- Launch the pack. This will install the mods and will close the game once done.
- Launch the pack again to play.

To create a Telomerase server:
- Download the latest `TelomeraseServer.zip` from https://github.com/TeloDev/Telomerase/releases
- Extract the zip file to a location that is convenient. Run the start script `ServerStart.bat` if on Windows or `ServerStartLinux.sh` if on Linux.
- This will run once and install your mods. It will stop and ask you to accept the eula which you must do by editing `eula.txt`
- Run the start script again. This will launch the server.
